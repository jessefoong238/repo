The official MAME has a "skip_gameinfo" build-in feature, it will skip the game info at the start screen.

Unfortunately, it unable to skip the compatibility/disclaimer warning screen.

The suppression patch (also known as NoNag), will remove the compatibility/disclaimer warning screen and others (.....such as white box) when used with the previously mentioned option.
