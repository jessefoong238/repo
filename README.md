About NoNag:

The official MAME has "skip_gameinfo" build-in feature.
It will skip the game info at the start screen.
The suppression patch (also known as NoNag),
will remove the compatibility/disclaimer warning
screen and others (.....such as white box)
when used with the previously mentioned option.
